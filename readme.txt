Redirects to the domain of the home url if the site loads with a different domain

== Description ==

Redirects to the domain of the home url if the site loads with a different domain.

A simple example. If the domain of your site is saved in your WordPress settings as "http://www.abc123.com" and someone goes to the URL "http://abc123.com/sample-post", a 301 redirect will be returned with a redirect to "http://www.abc123.com/sample-post"
